BACKGROUND

This project is my version of the capstone project for the google data analytics course.
For this case study i assumed the role of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analytics team at CYCLISTIC, a bike share company in chicago. Cyclistic offers over 5800 bikes at over 600 docking stations spread across the city of chicago.Two categories of riderships are currently available on cyclistic:
-casual riders;these are single-ride or full-day passes
-member riders;these riders have purchased an annual subscription.

ASK

The finance department at cyclistic have discovered annual riders to be more profitable to the company than casual riders.Lily moreno, the director of marketing and my manager sees a very good possibility of converting casual riders into member riders that are much more profitable for the business.With this in mind, i was handed the business task of finding out "How member and casual riders use cyclistic bikes differently".

PREPARE

For this business task, i would be using the most recent data, collected from\ the last 12 months at cyclistic.The required data are stored in a flat csv file format contained in a zip file. This data was made available by Motivate International Incorporated. The data was found to be reliable,original,comprehensive,current and cited and all personal customer information have been removed to protect their privacy.

For this analysis, R programming language was used due to the large size of the datasets. Tableau was also used for visualizing the data.

KEY FINDINGS

1.from the riders distribution above, we have more member riders than casual riders, with member riders taking up 59.77% of total riders.

2.From the dashboard,it can be observed that the member riders averaged the most number of rides per week.

3.The dashboard showed casual riders averaging more minutes on clistic bikes per month, compared to riders with annual membership,with january and december being the peak months.

4.It was observed that casual riders averaged more minutes in ride length per week day, with the most minutes recorded on wednesday and thurday.

5.classic bike was the most preferred bike type for all riders of cyclistic bikes.


RECOMMENDATIONS

1.From the insights gained in my analysis, i would recommend to the marketing team, in their bid to converting casual riders to riders with membership,to target days where casual riders are most active, which in this case is wednesdays and thursdays, to publish ad campaigns,convincing riders of the benefits of switching to annual membership.This campaign can also double as an incentive to member riders to keep renewing their subscription.

2.Having in mind the benefits the company stands to gain from flipping casual riders into member riders, special reward packages can be introduced, in the form of membership discount on rides. The idea of saving money can prove a big factor in flipping those casual riders into more profitable member riders.
